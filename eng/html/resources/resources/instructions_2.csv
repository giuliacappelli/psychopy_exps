"This survey takes about 30 minutes to complete. Be focused, but don’t spend too much time on each sentence.

You will see 320 sentences, one by one. For each, you are asked to judge how acceptable it is to you on a graded scale.

You should rate a sentence 1 if it sounds utterly bad, 7 if it sounds perfectly fine, or choose any in-between score if you think it applies."
"Let us consider some examples:

“John laughs stories.”
This sentence should score 1, because you can’t ""laugh something"".

“Mario walked on the path.”
This sentence should score 7, because it’s perfectly acceptable."
"This is not an exam! By virtue of being a native speaker of English, you will provide the right answers.

BEWARE: to avoid cheating and random clicking, the survey is interspersed with hidden control questions. If you fail them, you will be excluded from the experiment."
